RUN_HEADER task_id=12 seed=1012 timestamp_utc=2026-02-26T23:48:36Z hostname=clr1450

Causing intentional failure:
We set TID to 100 which is out of bounds for our 4x4 grid (max index 15).
Demonstrates workflow error handling using an explicit sanity-check trigger.
Our Python handles this with a ValueError and exits before wasting compute units.

To fix this, either remove the intentional failure block in run_worker.py
...or skip this task in the sweep.sbatch array definition
 (e.g., sbatch --array=0-11,13-15 sweep.sbatch).

To rerun the task, use: sbatch --array=12 sweep.sbatch

ERROR: task_id out of range! task_id=100 out of range for nx*ny=16
Exiting with code 42 to indicate specific failure...
